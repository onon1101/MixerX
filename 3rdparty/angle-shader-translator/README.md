# A portable GPLv3 C++14 distribution of the ANGLE shader translator library supporting CMake

This repository includes only the portions of ANGLE required to build the ANGLE shader translator
library. It also modifies portions of the source code to allow a more portable build (for instance,
removing most platform-dependent functionality) and to allow the repository to be built against the
C++14 standard.

The ANGLE source code in this repository is copyrighted by The ANGLE Project Authors and licensed
under a BSD-like license. However, the CMake scripts in this repository as well as the modifications
to the source code to allow the more portable build provided here are copyrighted by ds-sloth and
licensed under the GPLv3 (which includes no exceptions for static or dynamic linking). These scripts
and modifications are not licensed to be linked with non-GPLv3 software.

I am not able to fix and do not intend to fix any bugs in the ANGLE shader translator itself.
However, situations where this distribution of the shader translator differs in its output from the
original distribution should be considered defects of this distribution and I welcome any issues
reporting such defects. Such issues should include a test case demonstrating a difference between
this distribution of `shader_translator_sample` and the equivalent upstream build.

I may synchronize this distribution from time to time with the upstream ANGLE project, particularly
if any software utilizing it notices bugs that have been fixed upstream. The current revision is
synchronized with upstream commit 09c69b5b5cb987ff236fe11929a780a116a7a8bd.

Unlike https://github.com/ds-sloth/angle-shader-translator-library, this repository does not share
any history with the upstream ANGLE repository. It is thus much faster to clone for downstream CIs.

The dist-no-spirv branch of this repository additionally does not include the SPIRV submodules.
If you want a build using SPIRV, you need to clone them yourself or checkout the dist branch and
update the submodules.

# ANGLE - Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine

The goal of ANGLE is to allow users of multiple operating systems to seamlessly run WebGL and other
OpenGL ES content by translating OpenGL ES API calls to one of the hardware-supported APIs available
for that platform. ANGLE currently provides translation from OpenGL ES 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1 to Vulkan,
desktop OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Direct3D 9, and Direct3D 11. Future plans include ES 3.2, translation to
Metal and MacOS, Chrome OS, and Fuchsia support.

### Level of OpenGL ES support via backing renderers

|                |  Direct3D 9   |  Direct3D 11     |   Desktop GL   |    GL ES      |  Vulkan  |    Metal      |
|----------------|:-------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
| OpenGL ES 2.0  |    complete   |    complete      |    complete    |    complete   | complete |    complete   |
| OpenGL ES 3.0  |               |    complete      |    complete    |    complete   | complete |    complete   |
| OpenGL ES 3.1  |        | [incomplete][ES31OnD3D] |    complete    |    complete   | complete |               |
| OpenGL ES 3.2  |               |                  |  in progress   |  in progress  | complete |               |

Additionally, OpenGL ES 1.1 is implemented in the front-end using OpenGL ES 3.0 features.  This
version of the specification is thus supported on all platforms specified above that support OpenGL
ES 3.0 with [known issues][ES1].

ANGLE v1.0.772 was certified compliant by passing the OpenGL ES 2.0.3 conformance tests in October 2011.

ANGLE has received the following certifications with the Vulkan backend:
* OpenGL ES 2.0: ANGLE 2.1.0.d46e2fb1e341 (Nov, 2019)
* OpenGL ES 3.0: ANGLE 2.1.0.f18ff947360d (Feb, 2020)
* OpenGL ES 3.1: ANGLE 2.1.0.f5dace0f1e57 (Jul, 2020)
* OpenGL ES 3.2: ANGLE 2.1.2.21688.59f158c1695f (Sept, 2023)

ANGLE also provides an implementation of the EGL 1.5 specification.

ANGLE is used as the default WebGL backend for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox on Windows
platforms. Chrome uses ANGLE for all graphics rendering on Windows, including the accelerated
Canvas2D implementation and the Native Client sandbox environment.

Portions of the ANGLE shader compiler are used as a shader validator and translator by WebGL
implementations across multiple platforms. It is used on Mac OS X, Linux, and in mobile variants of
the browsers. Having one shader validator helps to ensure that a consistent set of GLSL ES shaders
are accepted across browsers and platforms. The shader translator can be used to translate shaders
to other shading languages, and to optionally apply shader modifications to work around bugs or
quirks in the native graphics drivers. The translator targets Desktop GLSL, Vulkan GLSL, Direct3D
HLSL, and even ESSL for native GLES2 platforms.
